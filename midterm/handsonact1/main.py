Hands-On Activity 1: Creating and Using a Class in Python
Objective:

Understand how to define a class, create objects, and access class attributes and methods.
Instructions:

    Define a class named Book with the following attributes:
        title (public)
        author (public)
        __price (private)

    Create a constructor that takes all three attributes as input when creating a new object.

    Create a public method get_price() to access the private __price attribute.

    Create another public method display_info() to print the bookâ€™s title, author, and price.

    Create two objects of the Book class and call the display_info() method for both.
